## Planned Upgrades

### Water Level Sensor Integration

**Status:** Parts on order - awaiting sensor extension components

**Purpose:** The sensor will be installed to detect when water reaches the top of the drain line, triggering the pump to run only when needed. This upgrade will:

- Reduce power consumption by eliminating interval-based pumping
- Extend powerbank runtime between solar charges
- Ensure the pump only operates when water is actually present
- Provide more efficient operation compared to the current timer-based system

**Current Operation:** Pump runs at scheduled intervals  
**Future Operation:** Pump runs on-demand when sensor detects water level

## Optional Components (Commonly Owned)

| Part Name                        | Price      | Link                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Concrete Screws (for wall mount) | $15.89 USD | [Amazon Link](https://a.co/d/f3adwhK) |

**Note:** Most homeowners already have concrete screws and the necessary tools (hammer drill) from past projects. If you need to purchase these items, add ~$15.89 to the total cost.

## Notes

### Adapter Selection

- The 90° adapter you choose depends on the cables you plan to use
- **USB-C to USB-C adapter is REQUIRED** - connects the Solar Panel (USB-C output) to the Powerbank
- **USB-A to USB-C adapter is OPTIONAL** - provides an alternative way to power the Apollo Pump-1
- The USB-C to USB-C adapter comes in a pack of 2

### General Notes

- Ensure all components are compatible with outdoor/humid environments
- Verify hose dimensions match the Apollo Pump-1 specifications
- Consider powerbank capacity based on pump usage frequency
- The Voltaic Systems V50 powerbank is specifically designed for solar charging applications
